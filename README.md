## App Installation

Install npm packages
```
 npm install
```
Copy .env-sample to .env.


If deploying on Heroku, skip .env setup. Instead, enter env variables in the Heroku App Dashboard under Settings -> Config Vars.
Replace client_id and client_secret in .env (from View Client ID in the dev portal).
During the init process you will be prompted to add a GitHub repository. Now would be a good time to make a new project on GitHub. Add the repo link to your `package.json` when prompted.

## Start the server
```
 npm run start
```
